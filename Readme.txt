BIT HOSTEL LAUNDRY

ABSTRACT

Most of the hostel students need a laundry facility to wash their clothes. 
We all know that it deals with removing dirt, sweat and oils. In BIT laundry, there are thousands of clothes received from the students per week. 
So it is hard to handle that many orders . 
Sometimes a student's bill may be lost and it may create chaos.
Sometimes they may cheat by not paying the bill amount .
Also if four students from the same room give clothes to laundry they all will be identified by their room number .
And also sometimes the clothes may not be ready to deliver and students approach laundry without knowing that the clothes are not ready to deliver .   
So, this application will be convenient for students to easily handle these things. 
This app contains 2 Panels: Admin and Student. 
In this application the order details will be stored using Mongodb so the loss of bill problem can be rectified . 
Also the payment can be done in the app as we will be integrating Razorpay payment gateway . 
The payment status will also be displayed . The Roll number of the student will serve as a unique key . 
Also the status of the order(whether ready to deliver or not) can be viewed in the app itself . 
After that the students can collect their dresses .
